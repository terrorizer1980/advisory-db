id: PYSEC-2018-3
package:
  name: django
  ecosystem: PyPI
details: An issue was discovered in Django 2.1 before 2.1.2, in which unprivileged
  users can read the password hashes of arbitrary accounts. The read-only password
  widget used by the Django Admin to display an obfuscated password hash was bypassed
  if a user has only the "view" permission (new in Django 2.1), resulting in display
  of the entire password hash to those users. This may result in a vulnerability for
  sites with legacy user accounts using insecure hashes.
